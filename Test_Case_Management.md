# **Test Case Management - Linked Worksheets & App Script**  

## **Problem**  
- Test cases were scattered across standalone documents, making tracking and updates difficult.  
- No real-time visibility into test readiness and completeness.  
- Manual data consolidation and validation were time-consuming and error-prone.  

---

## **Solution**  
- Interlinked test case sheets using custom formulas for real-time data synchronization.  
- Developed a Google Apps Script to automate test validation and priority management.  
- Enabled automated alerts for incomplete or missing test submodules, streamlining regression planning.
